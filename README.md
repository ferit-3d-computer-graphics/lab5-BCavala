# Lab 5: Textures and Materials in 3D 

---

This lab focuses on the integration of texture and textual information into 3D scenes using K3D. Students will learn how to apply 2D images (bitmaps) as textures on 3D surfaces, enabling more realistic or informative visualizations. They will also explore how to embed text into scenes for annotation or labeling ‚Äî both as flat 2D overlays and as extruded 3D objects. In addition, procedural approaches will be introduced to simulate surface variation and material properties, even without image-based textures.

Through hands-on examples, students will develop an understanding of how visual appearance can be enhanced using textures and text, contributing to both the readability and realism of 3D visualizations.

Learning objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
- Apply 2D bitmap textures to 3D objects in K3D.
- Use text labels as visual annotations or scene elements.
- Experiment with text rendering as both flat overlays and 3D geometries.
- Understand how material appearance is affected by color, lighting, and texture mapping.

# How to run notebook? 

Unfortunately, k3d extensions for Google Colab are in experimental phase, therefore you probably won't be able to run notebook on Google Colab
(widgets won't appear). 

# Installing Anaconda üêç and Running JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks

Follow these steps to install Anaconda and run your Python notebooks using either **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda

1. Go to the official Anaconda website:  
   üëâ https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

2. Download the **Anaconda Distribution** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the installer:
   - On **Windows**: Use the .exe installer and follow the prompts (select "Add Anaconda to PATH" if prompted).
   - On **macOS/Linux**: Use the .pkg or .sh installer via Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Once installation is complete, restart your computer (optional but recommended).

## Step 2: Launch Anaconda Navigator (GUI method)

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** from your Start Menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
2. From the Navigator interface, you can launch:
   - **Jupyter Notebook**
   - **JupyterLab**

---

## Step 3: Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (Terminal method)

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).
2. Your default web browser will open and show the interface.

---

## Step 4: Open and Run a Notebook

1. In the browser interface (Lab or Notebook), **navigate to the folder** containing your `.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the notebook to open it.
3. Run the cells using:
   - **Shift + Enter** to execute a cell.
   - The **"Run"** button in the toolbar.
